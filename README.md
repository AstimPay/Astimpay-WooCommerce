## Additional Notes

- **REST API**: The plugin uses a custom REST API route for IPN (Instant Payment Notification) handling. This allows AstimPay to communicate the payment status back to your WooCommerce store.
  - The IPN URL is: `/wp-json/astimpay/v1/ipn`
  
- **Logs**: AstimPay request and response data are logged for debugging purposes. Check the log files for any errors or debugging information.
